BigMart Sales Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a real-world retail sales dataset obtained from Kaggle.
The aim is to perform data preprocessing, descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and dashboard visualization to extract meaningful business insights from sales data.
